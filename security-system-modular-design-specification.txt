	0) NEW MODULE INSTALLED
		system knows types of modules and can try to use it to identify its location and function
		then by user acknowledgment - system can assign function to the module

		(*) function should be stored separately from module, having ID tag 
			outside module (in socket to module), only thing - if it is damaged, what to do, unless it is resistors

	1) MODULE REPLACEMENT ON SAME TYPE
		For that to work - we need to identify new module as a replacement of old one 
			(load its identification or replace it in system)

	1b) MODULE REPLACEMENT ON NEW TYPE
		same as removing module and installing new one

	1c) HOT REPLACEMENT
		How to hot start with no memory, or no ID (when replacing on new module)
		Question is on how to load configuration and prepare to continue work

	2) MCU REPLACEMENT
		For that to work - we need to load program to MCU
		Module can have ID for MCU program

	3) MODULE IS REMOVED

	4) SYSTEM RESET
		Reset every module one by one
