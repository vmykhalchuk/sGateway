Auto-discovery mechanism:
1) If module connection lost => 
2) Once per ten communication cycles => Ask if new modules installed
3) Recover module ID when module data was cleared
	
	
Procedures:
X1) turn on/off {on_off} system armed led
                                              (0..2)           B01000000
    D[$DEV_ARM_LED].action(set_port_[$DEV_ARM_LED__PORT], $DEV_ARM_LED__MASK, $on_off);

X2) Send SMS to owner {ownerNo}, {message}
    if ($gsm_no_signal) > { delayedCall(self, [$ownerNo, $message] , 2000); return; }
    D[$DEV_GSM].action(send_sms, $OWNERS_PHONE_NUMBERS[$ownerNo], $message); $gsm_sms_sending = true;


Requirements:
1) check balance once per hour and make sure balance is above limit
	If not - send sms notification
2) On request system arm
	2-1-a. check if working zones are closed
	2-1-b. exit/entry zone might be open
	2-1-c. window zones might also be open
	2-2-a. start buzzing if 1(a-c) conditions are met
	2-2-b. if conditions are not met - buzz differently (short error, etc)
	2-3. arm system
	2-3-1. turn system armed led
	2-3-2. set ownerNo = 0
	2-3-3. Send SMS to owner [ownerNo]
	2-3-4. Make call to owner [ownerNo]
	2-3-5. If call is rejected - exit
	2-3-6. If call is ignored - increment ownerNo and go to step 2-3-3
9) On request system disarm
	9-1a. stop timer of Pre-Alarm procedure (step 5)
	9-1b. stop syren
	9-1c. turn-off system armed led
	9-2. set ownerNo = 0
	9-3. Send SMS to owner [ownerNo]
	9-4. Make call to owner [ownerNo]
	9-5. If call is rejected - exit
	9-6. If call is ignored - increment ownerNo and go to step 9-3
3) Checking input ports
	3-0. If system is not armed
	3-1. If (system_is_armed && exit_or_entry_zone_triggered)
		3-1-A. if timedout since request of system arm
			start pre-alarm procedure (step 5)
	3-2. If other armed zone
		start alarm procedure
	3-3. If window zone state changes
		start alarm procedure
4) Alarm procedure
	4-1. run syren for 10 minutes
	4-2. set ownerNo = 0
	4-3. Send SMS to owner [ownerNo]
	4-4. Make call to owner [ownerNo]
	4-5. If call is rejected - exit
	4-6. If call is ignored - increment ownerNo and go to step 4-3
5) Pre-Alarm procedure
	5-1. start buzzing on console
	5-2. when timed-out and not disarmed - start Alarm procedure (step 4)
6) If communication of one of modules is lost (more then 3 packets lost or errored)
	6-1. Send SMS
	6-2. start Alarm procedure
7) If gsm signal is low / no electricity power / battery running low / electricity restored / 
	7-0. if same event happened less then 3min ago - exit
	7-1. send SMS to owner 0
8) If gsm signal is lost
	8-1. run syren for 10 minutes
	8-2. send sms when signal is restored
